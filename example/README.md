yadda example
=============

Example application showing `yadda` deployment.

To run the deployment, you will first need to create a Deployment Center and an
ECS cluster to run the tasks on. Afterwards, you will need to modify the
required files in `deployment/Manifest.js` and the environment files under
`deployment/env/` to include your deployment center information and your ECS
cluster info.
